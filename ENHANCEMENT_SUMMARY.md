## Ready for Production
The enhanced POS system is now ready for production use with dummy data, and can be easily connected to the real Golang backend by updating the datasources and API endpoints.

## Next Steps for Real Backend Integration
1. Update `Variables.baseUrl` with real backend URL
2. Replace dummy datasources with real API calls
3. Update authentication flow if needed
4. Add real error handling for network issues
5. Implement real data persistence

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a professional workshop management system integrated with POS functionality.
